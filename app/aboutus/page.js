                    <p className="text-[20px] text-black">Reader’s Digest was first published in 1922 by DeWitt Wallace and Lila Acheson Wallace. A man ahead of his time and the world’s earliest “content curator,” DeWitt Wallace recognized that people were hungry for information but overwhelmed by choice, so he began collecting the best stories from a vast array of publications and condensing them into what today is almost universally referred to as “the Reader’s Digest version.” Each issue contained 31 articles (one to read each day of the month) of “enduring value and interest, in condensed and compact form.” Within five years the Wallaces were printing and distributing 30,000 copies.<br/>By the 1940s, the Digest had surpassed 1 million copies a month and was the best selling publication in America—exceeded in sales only by the Bible and spreading its own gospel of “America the Great.”</p>
